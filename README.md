# MY DOT_FILES
An always work in progress repo for my dotfiles.
- neovim using Lua


## Setup

For symlinking
run `brew install stow`
run `stow */` in the clone repo. This links all folders and directories
Note, if you are running into errors with .DS_STORE etc, you might want to `stow stow/` and move the stow ignore file first

For lua formatting (like prettier for TS/JS)
run `brew install stylua`
