# Dotfiles
An always work in progress repo for my dotfiles.

## Setup

#### For symlinking
- run `brew install stow`
- run `stow stow/` to setup stow ignore before anything else, to make sure we ignore .DS_STORE etc.
- run `stow */` then symlink everything else

#### For ZSH
- follow the instructions on https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh

## TODO
- At the moment I am just using 'ohmyzsh' for a quick zsh setup.
